# SM64-recreated-in-Godot



This is Godot project of a recreation of the infamous Super Mario 64. More specifically, one of its levels, Hazy Maze Cave. It is __very much__ work in progress, so any code or resource contribution is welcome.



## Controls

Use the arrow keys, or the left control stick to move Mario. In both cases you can scroll your mouse wheel to speed up, or slow down. There's currently no cap for this as it is just for testing.

To jump press the X key, or the A/B buttons on your gamepad.

To punch press the Z key, or the X/Y buttons on your gamepad.

To crouch press the Shift key, or the second set of L/R buttons your gamepad has.

You can turn the camera with the A and D keys, or with the right control stick.

You can also take a screenshot with F2.

For testing purposes, the Q key allows you to jump indefinitely.
